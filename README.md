# Freedom Adventures Game

## Story
 In this biblically-inspired game, you embark on a self discovery journey within a 2D world. Guided by a glowing candle, you venture forth with nothing but this and a bleak mindset. As you traverse the untouched terrain, you encounter a blend of challenges and blessings. You discover enigmatic, hobbit-like holes and tunnels, symbolizing the hidden treasures of scripture and offering opportunities to uncover wisdom and truthful knowledge.

## Purpose
 As you navigate, solve dilemmas, and uncover treasures, you gain insights not only about the game's world but, more importantly, about yourself and your relationship with Jesus. The game metaphorically represents the Christian path, where every step, every challenge, and every decision offers opportunities for spiritual growth and understanding. Your journey is transformative, much like the Christian faith, and a reminder that even in the darkest moments, the light of faith and the love God has for you, symbolized by your guiding candle, can illuminate the way, providing hope and a future.
